/*!
 * A contract that acts like an account (can send, store and accept CCD),
 * but requires n > 1 ordained accounts to agree to the sending of CCD
 * before it is accepted. This is useful for storing CCD where the security
 * of just one account isnâ€™t considered high enough.
 *
 * Transfer requests time out if not agreed to within the contract's
 * specified time-to-live for transfer requests
 *
 * Transfer requests are given IDs to disambiguate otherwise identical
 * requests, since they might have different motivations behind the scenes,
 * making them not-quite fungible (e.g. for accounting purposes it might be
 * necessary for account holders to track a particular named transfer).
 *
 * Depositing funds:
 *   Allowed at any time from anyone.
 *
 * Transferring funds:
 *   Only requestable by accounts named at initialization, and only with the
 *   agreement of at least n of those accounts, but can send to any account.
 *
 * At the point when a transfer/withdrawal is requested, the account balance
 * is checked. Either there are not enough funds and the request is
 * rejected, or there are enough funds and the requested sum is set aside
 * (and can be re-added to the balance if the request times out).
 *
 * TODO Consider allowing the person who initially made the request to
 * cancel it, iff it is still outstanding.
