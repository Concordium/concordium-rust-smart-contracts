//! An example contract (`contract-version1`) that can be upgraded. The contract
//! has a function to upgrade the smart contract instance to a new module and
//! call optionally a migration function after the upgrade. To use this example,
//! deploy `contract-version1` and then upgrade the smart contract instance to
//! `contract-version2` by invoking the `upgrade` function with the below JSON
//! inputParameter:
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "migrate": {
//!     "Some": [
//!       [
//!         "migration",
//!         ""
//!       ]
//!     ]
//!   },
//!   "module": "<ModuleReferenceContractVersion2>"
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `contract-version2` includes a `migration` function
//! that converts the shape of the smart contract state from `contract-version1`
//! to `contract-version2`.
