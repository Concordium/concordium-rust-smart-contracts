//! A voting smart contract example.
//!
//! # Description
//! A contract that allows for conducting an election with several voting
//! options. A deadline is set when the election is initialized. Only
//! accounts are eligible to vote. Each account can change its
//! selected voting option as often as it desires until the deadline is
//! reached. No voting will be possible after the deadline.
//!
//! # Operations
//! The contract allows for
//!  - Initializing the election (`init` function).
//!  - Viewing general information about the election (`view` function).
//!  - Voting for one of the voting options (`vote` function).
//!  - Tallying votes for a requested voting option (`getNumberOfVotes`
//!    function).
