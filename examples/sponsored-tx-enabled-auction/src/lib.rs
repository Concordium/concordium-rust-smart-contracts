//! # Implementation of an auction smart contract
//!
//! The contract is initialized with a cis2 token contract.
//! Any `token_id` from this cis2 token contract can be used as a payment
//! token when auctioning an item within this contract.
//!
//! To initiate a new auction, any account can call the `addItem` entry point.
//! The account initiating the auction (referred to as the creator) is required
//! to specify the start time, end time, minimum bid, and the `token_id`
//! associated with the item. At this stage, the item/auction is assigned the
//! next consecutive index for future reference.
//!
//! Any account can bid for an item.
//! The `bid` entry point in this contract is not meant to be invoked directly
//! but rather through the `onCIS2Receive` hook mechanism in the cis2 token
//! contract. The `bid` entry point can be invoked via a sponsored transaction
//! mechanism (`permit` entry point) in case it is implemented in the cis2 token
//! contract. The bidding flow starts with an account invoking either the
//! `transfer` or the `permit` entry point in the cis2 token contract and
//! including the `item_index` in the `additionalData` section of the input
//! parameter. The `transfer` or the `permit` entry point will send some token
//! amounts to this contract from the bidder. If the token amount exceeds the
//! current highest bid, the bid is accepted and the previous highest bidder is
//! refunded its token investment.
//!
//! The smart contract keeps track of the current highest bidder as well as
//! the token amount of the highest bid. The token balances of the smart
//! contract represent the sums of all highest bids from the items (that haven't
//! been finalized). When a new highest bid is accepted by the smart
//! contract, the smart contract refunds the old highest bidder.
//!
//! Bids have to be placed before the auction ends. The participant with the
//! highest bid (the last accepted bidder) wins the auction.
//!
//! After the auction ends for a specific item, any account can finalize the
//! auction. The creator of that auction receives the highest bid when the
//! auction is finalized and the item is marked as sold to the highest bidder.
//! This can be done only once.
