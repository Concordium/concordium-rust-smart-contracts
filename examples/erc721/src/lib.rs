/*
 * An implementation of the "ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token(NFT) Standard"
 * specification popular on the Ethereum blockchain.
 *
 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721
 *
 * # Description
 * A smart contract instance represents a number of NFTs and tracks
 * ownership of each. The globally unique id of an NFT is formed by the
 * address of the contract instance and some token_id unique to the instance.
 *
 * A token can be transferred to an address (either an account and a contract
 * instance). Each token can be approved to be transferred by one other
 * address than the owner. Approvals can be done by either the token
 * owner or an "operator" of the owner.
 *
 * An address can enable one or more addresses as operators.
 * An operator of some address is allowed to transfer and approve any tokens
 * of the owner.
 * Note: This can be used to implement 'atomic swap' in another contract.
 *
 * ## Differences from the specification
 *
 * Since the specification is written to target the Ethereum blockchain, some
 * details are implemented differently.
 *
 * - The specification contains a number of "view" functions, which queries
 *   for the current state of the contract and since the Concordium
 *   Blockchain uses message passing for inter-contract communication, these
 *   query functions must also take a name of a function to callback with the
 *   result of the query.
 * - The specification uses a "zero address" (which is a special address used
 *   as a null-address) which is not a thing on Concordium blockchain,
 *   instead when relevant a byte is used to represent whether the address is
 *   the "zero address" and if not the address is followed, which in a Rust
 *   smart contract corresponds to the serialization of `Option<Address>`.
 *
 * Note that the specification also requires implementing ERC165 for standard
 * interface detection, which is not implemented in this example.
