//! A contract implementing an eSealing service.
//!
//! If you seal a file, you can prove that it was in your possession at the time
//! of sealing. The dApp flow will be:
//! - Upload a file from the computer at the front-end => register its file hash
//!   in the smart contract
//! - Upload a file from the computer at the front-end => retrieve the timestamp
//!   and witness (sender_account) from the smart contract to prove that the
//!   witness (sender_account) was in possession of that file at that time.
//!
//! Only accounts can register a file hash. During the registration, the
//! timestamp is recorded together with the witness (sender_account) that
//! registered the file hash. Each file hash can only be registered once.
//! This is because we want to record the first time when the witness
//! (sender_account) had access to that file. Re-registering a file hash (by a
//! different witness) would not prove that the second witness is also in
//! possession of that file because the second witness could have read the
//! file hash during the initial registration transaction from the blockchain.
