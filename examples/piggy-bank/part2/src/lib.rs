//! Piggy bank smart contract.
//!
//! Allows anyone to insert CCD, but only the owner can "smash" it and
//! retrieve the CCD. Prevents more CCD to be inserted after being smashed.
//!
//! This smart contract module is developed as part of the
//! [Piggy Bank Tutorial](https://developer.concordium.software/en/mainnet/smart-contracts/tutorials/piggy-bank).
//!
//! Covers:
//! - Reading owner, sender and self_balance from the context and host.
//! - The `ensure` macro.
//! - The `payable` attribute.
//! - The `mutable` attribute.
//! - Invoking a transfer with the host.
//! - Integration testing (in the `/tests/tests.rs file`)
//! - Custom errors.

// Pulling in everything from the smart contract standard library.
