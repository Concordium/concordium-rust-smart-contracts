//! Piggy bank smart contract.
//!
//! Allows anyone to insert GTU, but only the owner can "smash" it and
//! retrieve the GTU. Prevents more GTU to be inserted after being smashed.
//!
//! This smart contract module is developed as part of a upcoming tutorial on
//! developing smart contracts.
//!
//! Covers:
//! - Reading owner, sender and self_balance from the context.
//! - The `ensure` macro.
//! - The `payable` attribute.
//! - Creating a simple transfer action.

// Pulling in everything from the smart contract standard library.
