/// A high-level map based on the low-level key-value store, which is the

///
/// In most situations, this collection should be preferred over
/// [`BTreeMap`][btm] and [`HashMap`][hm] since it will be more efficient to
/// lookup and update since costs to lookup and update will grow very slowly
/// with the size of the collection. In contrast, using [`BTreeMap`][btm] and
/// [`HashMap`][hm] almost always entails their serialization, which is linear
/// in the size of the collection.
///

/// and the size of the data stored (`V`). Short keys are therefore ideal.
///
/// New maps can be constructed using the
/// [`new_map`][StateBuilder::new_map] method on the [`StateBuilder`].
///
///
/// ```
/// # use concordium_std::*;
/// # use concordium_std::test_infrastructure::*;
/// # let mut state_builder = TestStateBuilder::new();
/// /// In an init method:
/// let mut map1 = state_builder.new_map();

/// ```
///
/// ## Type parameters
///
/// The map `StateMap<K, V, S>` is parametrized by the type of _keys_ `K`, the
/// type of _values_ `V` and the type of the low-level state `S`. In line with
/// other Rust collections, e.g., [`BTreeMap`][btm] and [`HashMap`][hm]
/// constructing the statemap via [`new_map`](StateBuilder::new_map) does not
/// require anything specific from `K` and `V`. However most operations do
/// require that `K` is serializable and `V` can be stored and loaded in the
/// context of the low-level state `S`.
///
/// This concretely means that `K` must implement
/// [`Serialize`](crate::Serialize) and `V` has to implement
/// [`Serial`](crate::Serial) and
/// [`DeserialWithState<S>`](crate::DeserialWithState). In practice, this means
/// that keys must be _flat_, meaning that it cannot have any references to the
/// low-level state. This is almost all types, except [`StateBox`], [`StateMap`]
/// and [`StateSet`] and types containing these.
///
/// However values may contain references to the low-level state, in particular
/// maps may be nested.
///
/// ### Low-level state `S`
///
/// The type parameter `S` is extra compared to usual Rust collections. As
/// mentioned above it specifies the [low-level state
/// implementation](crate::HasStateApi). This library provides two such
/// implementations. The "external" one, which is the implementation supported
/// by external host functions provided by the chain, and a
/// [test](crate::test_infrastructure::TestStateApi) one. The latter one is
/// useful for testing since it provides an implementation that is easier to
/// construct, execute, and inspect during unit testing.
///
/// In user code this type parameter should generally be treated as boilerplate,
/// and contract entrypoints should always be stated in terms of a generic type
/// `S` that implements [HasStateApi](crate::HasStateApi)
///
/// #### Example
/// ```rust
/// # use concordium_std::*;
/// #[derive(Serial, DeserialWithState)]
/// #[concordium(state_parameter = "S")]
/// struct MyState<S: HasStateApi> {
///     inner: StateMap<u64, u64, S>,
/// }
/// #[init(contract = "mycontract")]
/// fn contract_init<S: HasStateApi>(
///     _ctx: &impl HasInitContext,
///     state_builder: &mut StateBuilder<S>,
/// ) -> InitResult<MyState<S>> {
///     Ok(MyState {
///         inner: state_builder.new_map(),
///     })
/// }
///
/// #[receive(contract = "mycontract", name = "receive", return_value = "Option<u64>")]
/// fn contract_receive<S: HasStateApi>(
///     _ctx: &impl HasReceiveContext,
///     host: &impl HasHost<MyState<S>, StateApiType = S>, // the same low-level state must be propagated throughout
/// ) -> ReceiveResult<Option<u64>> {
///     let state = host.state();
///     Ok(state.inner.get(&0).map(|v| *v))
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## **Caution**
///
/// `StateMap`s must be explicitly deleted when they are no longer needed,
/// otherwise they will remain in the contract's state, albeit unreachable.
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use concordium_std::*;
