//! This library provides the core API that can be used to write smart contracts
//! for the Concordium blockchain. It aims to provide safe wrappers around the
//! core primitives exposed by the chain and accessible to smart contracts.
//!
//! By default the library will be linked with the
//! [std](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/) crate, the rust standard library,
//! however to minimize code size this library supports toggling compilation
//! with the `#![no_std]` attribute via the feature `std` which is enabled by
//! default. Compilation without the `std` feature requires a nightly version of
//! rust.
//!
//! To use this library without the `std` feature you have to disable it, which
//! can be done, for example, as follows.
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies.concordium-std]
//! default-features = false
//! ```
//! In your project's `Cargo.toml` file.
//!
//! The library is meant to be used as a standard library for developing smart
//! contracts. For this reason it re-exports a number of definitions from other
//! libraries.
//!
//! # Global allocator
//! Importing this library has a side-effect of setting  the allocator to [wee_alloc](https://docs.rs/wee_alloc/)
//! which is a memory allocator aimed at small code footprint.
//! This allocator is designed to be used in contexts where there are a few
//! large allocations up-front, and the memory is afterwards used by the program
//! without many further allocations. Frequent small allocations will have bad
//! performance, and should be avoided.
//!
//! In the future it will be possible to opt-out of the global allocator via a
//! feature.
//!
//! # Panic handler
//! When compiled without the `std` feature this crate sets the panic handler
//! so that it terminates the process immediately, without any unwinding or
//! prints.
//! Concretely, when compiled to the `wasm32` target panic boils down to the
//! `unreachable` instruction, which triggers a runtime failure, aborting
//! execution of the program.
//!
//! # Build for generating a module schema
//! **WARNING** Building with this feature enabled is meant for tooling, and the
//! result is not intended to be deployed on chain.
//!
//! This library provides a way to automate the building of smart contract
//! module schema, by allowing the contract to be built exporting getter
//! functions for the `concordium_contracts_common::schema::Type` of Types for
//! contract state and parameters.
//! This special build is only intended to be used for generating the schema
//! and is not meant to be deployed, since the build exports functions that do
//! not conform to the expected API of smart contracts.
//! The build is enabled by setting the feature `build-schema`.
//!
//! **Note** This feature is used by `cargo-concordium`, when building with
//! schema and for most cases this feature should not be set manually.
//!
//! # Build for testing in Wasm
//! **WARNING** Building with this feature enabled is meant for tooling, and the
//! result is not intended to be deployed on chain.
//!
//! The macros [`#[concordium_test]`](attr.concordium_test.html) and
//! [`#[concordium_cfg_test]`](attr.concordium_cfg_test.html) are reduced to
//! `#[test]` and `#[cfg(test)]` unless the `wasm-test` feature is enabled.
//!
//! With the `wasm-test` feature enabled, the
//! [`#[concordium_test]`](attr.concordium_test.html) macro exports the test as
//! an `extern` function, allowing tools such as `cargo-concordium` to call the
//! test functions directly, when compiled to Wasm.
//! Without the feature it falls back to `#[test]`.
//!
//! With the 'wasm-test' feature enabled, the
//! [`#[concordium_cfg_test]`](attr.concordium_cfg_test.html) macro allows the
//! annotated code to be included in the build. Without the feature, it falls
//! back to `#[cfg(test)]`.
//!
//! **Note** This feature is used by `cargo-concordium`, when building for
//! testing and for most cases this feature should not be set manually.
//!
//! # Traits
//! To support testing of smart contracts most of the functionality is
//! accessible via traits. This library generally provides two implementations
//! of most traits. The first one is supported by **host** functions, and this
//! is the implementation that is used when contracts are executed by nodes. The
//! second set of implementations supports testing of contracts and it is
//! defined in the [test_infrastructure](./test_infrastructure/index.html)
//! module.
//!
//! - [HasParameter] for accessing the contract parameter
//! - [HasCommonData] for accessing the data that is common to both init and
//!   receive methods
//! - [HasInitContext] for all the context data available to the init functions
//!   (note that this includes all the common data)
//! - [HasReceiveContext] for accessing all the context data available to the
//!   receive functions (note that this includes all the common data)
//! - [HasLogger] for logging data during smart contract execution
//! - [HasPolicy] for accessing the policy of the sender, either of the init or
//!   receive method
//! - [HasStateApi] for operations possible on the contract state
//! - [HasHost] for invoking operations on the host and accessing the state
//!
//! # Signalling errors
//! On the Wasm level contracts can signal errors by returning a negative i32
//! value as a result of either initialization or invocation of the receive
//! method. If the error is a logic error and the contract executes successfully
//! then it can also produce a return value, which may provide additional detail
//! of the error to the caller. To make error handling more pleasant we provide
//! the [Reject](./struct.Reject.html) structure. The result type of a contract
//! init or a receive method is assumed to be of the form `Result<_, E>` where
//! `Reject: From<E>`.
//!
//! Producing return values is in case of errors is not yet supported by this
//! library, although smart contract writers can do this manually using the
//! [Write] implementation of the [ExternReturnValue] type.
//!
//! With respect to error **codes**, the intention is that smart contract
//! writers will write their own custom, precise, error types and either
//! manually implement `Reject: From<E>` for their type `E`, or use the [Reject
//! macro](./derive.Reject.html) which supports the common use cases.
//!
//! In addition to the custom errors that signal contract-specific error
//! conditions this library provides some common error cases that most contracts
//! will have to handle and their conversions to [Reject](./struct.Reject.html).
//! These are
//!
